1)The benefit of Dijsktra’s algorithm is that it is more efficient and can be used for processing large graphs. However, the algorithm requires that there are no negative weight edges in the graph.
2)At each step, Dijkstra’s algorithm selects a node that has not been processed
yet and whose distance is as small as possible. The first such node is node 1 with distance 0.
3)adj[a] contains a pair (b,w) always when there is an edge from node a to node b with weight w.
4)In the following code, the priority queue q contains pairs of the form (−d, x),
meaning that the current distance to node x is d.

priority_queue<pair<lli,lli>>q;
vector<lli>p(n+1,-1);
vector<bool>vis(n+1,false);
for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)dis[i]=INF;
dis[x]=0;
q.push({0,x});
while(!q.empty())
{
  int s=q.top().S;
  q.pop();
  if(vis[s])continue;
  vis[s]=true
  for(auto u:adj[s])
  {
    int b=u.F;
    int w=u.S;
    if(dis[s]+w<dis[b])
    {
      dis[b]=dis[s]+w;
      p[b]=s;
      q.push({-dis[b],b});
    }
  }
}
